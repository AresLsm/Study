# Amazon Neptune

- Fast, reliable, and secure and fully managed graph database service.

- Graph databases are essentially used to help you both store and navigate relationships between highly  
  connected data which could contain billions of separate relationships. As a result, graph databases are  
  ideal if their focus is on being able to identify these relationships of interconnected data, rather than  
  the actual data itself. Trying to perform queries against complex relationships will be very difficult  
  in a normal relational database model. And so graph databases are recommended in this scenario instead.

## Use Cases

### Social Networking

- Graph databases are a powerful asset when used within a social networking environment.

- Like as in the image above, there are vast webs of tightly networked data that run across social  
  networking platforms, and understanding these relationships and being able to query against them  
  is vital to being able to build and maintain effective social network applications.

### Fraud Detection

- If you are carrying out financial transactions within your environment, then you can build applications  
  that allow Neptune to analyze the financial relationships of transactions to help you detect potential  
  fortunate activity patterns in near real time response times. For example, you might be able to detect  
  that multiple parties are trying to use the same financial details, all from various different locations.

### Recommendation Engines

- Using Neptune as a key component within your recommendation engine allows it to perform complex queries  
  based upon various different activities and operations made by the user that will help determine  
  recommendations of what your customer may like to purchase next.

## Components

### Query Languages

- Amazon Neptune uses its own graph database engine and supports two graph query frameworks.  
  These being Apache Tinkerpop Gremlin, and this allows you to query your graph running on your Neptune database,  
  using the Gremlin traversal language. And we have the Worldwide Web Consortium Sparql. The Sparql query language  
  has been designed to work with the internet and can be used to run queries against your Neptune database graph.

### Database clusters, instances and storage

- An Amazon Neptune database cluster is comprised of a single, or if required, multiple database instances  
  across different availability zones, in addition to a virtual database cluster volume which contains the data  
  across all instances within the cluster. The single cluster volume consists of a number of Solid State Discs, SSDs.  
  As your graph database grows, your shared volume will automatically scale an increase in size as required  
  to a maximum of 64 terabytes.

## High availability and reliability

- To ensure high availability is factored into Neptune, each cluster maintains a separate copy of the  
  shared volume in at least three different availability zones.  
  This provides a high level of durability to the data.

- From a storage perspective, Amazon Neptune has another great feature to help with the durability and reliability  
  of data being stored across your shared cluster, this being Neptune Storage Auto-Repair.

- Storage Auto-Repair will automatically find and detect any segment failures that are present in the SSDs  
  that make up the shared volume, and then automatically repair that segment using the data from the other volumes  
  in the cluster. This ensures that the data loss is minimized and the need to restore from a failure is  
  drastically reduced.

- Similarly to other AWS database services, Amazon Neptune also has the capability to implement and run  
  replica instances. If replicas are used, then each Neptune cluster will contain a primary database instance,  
  which will be responsible for any read and write operations. The Neptune replicas, however, are used to  
  scale your read operations, and so support read-only operations to the same cluster volume that the  
  primary database instance connects to. As the replicas connect to the same source data as the primary,  
  any read query results served by the replicas have minimal lag, typically less than a 100 milliseconds  
  after new data has been written to the volume.

- A maximum limit of 15 replicas per crust exists which can span multiple availability zones.  
  And this ensures that should have failure occur in the availability zone hosting the primary database,  
  one of the Neptune read replicas in a different AZ will be promoted to the primary database instance,  
  and adopt both read and write operations. This process usually takes about 30 seconds.

- Data is synchronized between the primary database instance and each replica synchronously.  
  And in addition to providing a failover to your primary database instance, they offer support to read only queries.  
  These queries can be served by your replicas, instead of utilizing resources on your primary instance.

## Connecting to Neptune

- You can connect to Neptune instance by using its endpoint. There are three different types of Amazon Neptune endpoints.

  - Cluster endpoint
    - Points directly to the current primary DB instance of a cluster.
    - Should be used by applications that require both read and write access to the database.
    - When primary DB instance fails, it will point to the new primary instance without any changes required  
      by your applications accessing the database.
  - Reader endpoint
    - Used to connect to read replicas.
    - Allows applications to access your database on a read only basis for queries.
    - Only a single reader endpoint exists, even if you have multiple read replicas.
    - Connections served by the read replicas will be performed on a round-robin basis.
    - The endpoint does not load balance your traffic in any way across the available replicas in your cluster.
  - Instance endpoint
    - Every instance within a cluster has a unique instance endpoint.
    - Allows you to direct certain traffic to specific instances within a cluster.
    - You might want to use this for load balancing reason across your applications reading from your replicas.
