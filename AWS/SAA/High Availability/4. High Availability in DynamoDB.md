# High Availability in DynamoDB

## AWS DynamoDB HA Options

- AWS DynamoDB

  - NoSQL schemaless managed service
  - Built and provided by AWS
  - Designed internally to automatically partition data and incoming traffic across **multiple partitions**
  - Partitions are stored on **numerous backend servers** distributed across **3 AZs** within a single region.

- DynamoDB takes care of performing both the partition management and replication for you.
- The synchronous AZ replication provides protection against any single node outage and/or a full AZ outage.
- The synchronous replication takes place using low latency interconnections between each of the AZs  
  within a region and ensures high speed sub second replication.

### Global Tables

- DynamoDB provides a secondary layer of availability in the form of cross-region replication.
- A Global Table gives you the capability to replicate a single table across 1 or many alternate regions.
- A Global Table elevates the availability of your data and enables applications to take advantage of data locality.
- Users can be served data directly from the closest geographicaly located table replica.

> You cannot configure Global Table in different AWS accounts.

- Global Tables implement multi-master read/write capability with eventual consistency.
- Both read, writes can be performed against any one of the configured global tables.
- All writes will then be replicated in near sub second time to all other globally configured tables of the same  
  table name.

> Existing DynamoDB tables can be converted into Global Tables later on.
