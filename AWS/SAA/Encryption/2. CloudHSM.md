# CloudHSM

## What is CloudHSM?

- HSM: Hardware Security Module

  - HSM is a tamper-resistant hardware appliance that is used to protect and safeguard cryptographic material  
    and encryption keys.

- AWS CloudHSM service provides HSMs that are validated to Federal Information Processing Standards (FIPS)  
  140-2 Level 3, which is often required if you are going to be using your CloudHSM for document signing  
  or if you intend to operate a public certificate authority for SSL certificates.

- CloudHSM is a physical device, and it’s important to note that this device is not shared with any other customer,  
  so it’s NOT a multi-tenant device. It is a dedicated single-tenant appliance exclusively made available to you,  
  for your own workloads.

- CloudHSM is an enterprise-class service used for secure encryption key management and storage which can be used  
  as a root of trust for an enterprise when it comes to data protection allowing you to deploy secure and compliant  
  workloads within AWS.

- There are a number of different operations that CloudHSM can help you provide:

  - The creating, storage and management of cryptographic keys, allowing you to import and export both  
    asymmetric and symmetric keys.

  - The ability to use cryptographic hash functions to enable you to compute message digests and hash-based message  
    authentication codes, otherwise knows as HMACs.

  - Cryptographic data signing and signature verification.

  - Using boty asymmetric and symmetric encryption algorithms.

  - Ability to generate cryptographically secure random data.

### Asymmetric Encryption

- Asymmetric encryption involves two different keys:

  - One key is used to encrypt the data.
  - Another key is used to decrypt the data.

- Two keys are both created at the same time, and are linked through a mathematical algorithm.

- One key is considered the _private key_ and should be kept by a single party and should never be shared with  
  anyone else. The other key is considered the _public key_ and this key cna be given and shared with anyone.

- It doesn't matter who has access to the public key, as without the private key, any data encrypted with it  
  cannot be accessed.

- Common examples of asymmetric cryptography algorithms:
  - RSA
  - Diffie-Hellman
  - Digital Signature Algorithm

### Symmetric Encryption

- A single key is used to both encrypt and also decrypt the data.

- This key must be sent securely between the two parties, and here it exposes a weakeness in this method.
- If the key is intercepted by anyone during that transmission, then that third party could easily decrypt any  
  data associated with that key.

- Common examples of symmetric cryptography algorithms:

  - AES
  - DES
  - Triple-DES

- AWS CloudHSM is not the only encryption service available with AWS, there is also KMS.  
  KMS is a managed service used to store and generate encryption keys that can be used by other AWS services  
  and applications to encrypt your data. Much like CloudHSM, KMS uses HSMs, but with KMS, these are managed by AWS,  
  as a result you have less management control of the keys and key material.

## Understanding AWS CloudHSM architecture & implementation

### CloudHSM Cluster

- When you implement CloudHSM, you will begin by creating a cluster.  
  This cluster is simply a grouping of different HSMs which will act as a single unit when configured and deployed.  
  Having multiple HSMs provides an element of high availability as you are able to select multiple different subnets,  
  one from each availability zone that your VPC operates in, to deploy an HSM into. Any requests to your CloudHSM  
  cluster are then automatically load-balanced between the HSMs in the cluster, and if one HSM fails, AWS will  
  automatically deploy another one within your cluster. As a result, running a VPC is a prerequisite of implementing your cluster.

- During the deployment of your HSMs, it’s actually an Elastic Network Interface (ENI) that is placed within the subnet  
  that you select of your VPC. The HSM itself actually resides in a different AWS-owned VPC, and located in the same AZ  
  as you select during its deployment. So it’s the ENI that is deployed in your VPC which acts as an interface between  
  your network and the HSM residing in an AWS-owned VPC.

- When you create a CloudHSM Cluster, CloudHSM will do 2 things.

  - (1) Create a new service-linked role called `AWSServiceRoleForCloudHSM`, which gives CloudHSM the permission to send  
    log data to CloudWatch Logs log groups and log streams on your behalf.

  - (2) A new security group for the cluster is created, which will control which resources can communicate with the  
    HSMs. The security group itself will allow both inbound and outbound connectivity over TCP ports 2223~2225, which  
    enables each of your HSMs within your cluster to communicate with each other.

- Once your cluster has been defined and created in the different subnets and availability zones that you have selected,  
  it will have been provisioned in an `uninitialized state`. From this point, you can create your HSMs in each AZ  
  that you selected and `‘initialize’` the cluster.

- When your cluster is initialized you can then connect to your cluster HSM network interfaces, and one of the easiest  
  ways to do this is via an EC2 instance provisioned in the same VPC.

  - There are 2 steps which must be carried out for your EC2 instances to interact with the HSMs:

    - (1) You must configure a security group.
      - Add your instance to the security group created when you created your cluster.
    - (2) You need to install the AWS CloudHSM client software on your instance.

- In the infrastructure above:

  - There is a VPC split across 3 different AZs and subnets, each with an EC2 client containing the HSM client  
    software and an HSM ENI. Each EC2 client can communicate with ANY of the HSM ENIs across the different subnets  
    within the cluster.

  - ENIs can communicate with the HSMs located in an AWS-owned VPC

## Using CloudHSM as a Custom Key Store in KMS

- AWS KMS enables you to create custom key stores, which is a storage location which can store and protect your  
  cryptographic keys used to encrypt/decrypt your data in AWS.

- The default key stores are:

  - Managed by KMS
  - Stored on HSMs managed by AWS
    > - This means that you have no control over these HSMs.

- AWS KMS allows you to perform server-side encryption often at the click of a button with minimal configuration required.

- KMS creates and stores Customer Master Keys (CMKs) which is the main key type in KMS and there are two types of  
  customer master keys:

  - Managed by customers of AWS, which can be created by using KMS.
  - Managed and created by AWS themselves.

- CMKs that are generated and created by us as customers, rather than AWS, provide the ability to implement greater  
  flexibility, such as being able to manage the key, including rotation, governing access and key policy configuration,  
  along with being able to both enable and disable the key when it is no longer required.

- So, if within your organisation you want to use the seamless integration of KMS with many AWS services, but require  
  the security and compliance of maintaining your own key material outside of KMS then you can create a custom key store  
  backed by your CloudHSM cluster.

- The custom key store is a resource managed from within KMS, but allows you to store your key material within your  
  managed HSMs of your CloudHSM cluster. This allows you to use the key material located within your HSM cluster  
  to create the CMKs that KMS uses to implement encryption across different AWS services. CMKs created from your  
  custom key store are 256-bit, non-exportable AES symmetric keys that never leave the HSM unencrypted.  
  All cryptographic operations made with the CMK happens within the HSM cluster.

- So as you can see from this diagram, AWS services use CMKs managed by KMS using existing integration, but your  
  CMKs can either come from the default key store created and stored by HSMs managed by AWS, or by using the  
  custom key store which are managed by you allowing you to control access to your key material used within the CMKs.

- Bear in mind that each HSM Cluster can only be associated with one custom key store for KMS, and both the cluster  
  and the KMS creation of the custom key store must be within the same region. KMS is a regional service, and keys can’t  
  be used between multiple regions. If you want to create CMKs within your custom key store, then your cluster must  
  have at least 2 HSMs activated in different availability zones.

- As a part of the process to create your custom key store you must upload the trust anchor certificate for the  
  cluster to KMS, and this certificate is generated when the cluster is first initialized. Also, you must create  
  a dedicated Crypto User(CU) called kmsuser (without 2 factor authentication) and generate a password, which you  
  then provide to KMS. Going forward, KMS will use this kmsuser CU to perform its operations in addition to rotating  
  the password every time the user is authenticated.
