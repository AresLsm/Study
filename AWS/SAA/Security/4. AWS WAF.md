# AWS WAF(Web Application Firewall)

## AWS WAF Overview

- AWS WAF can add an additional layer of security when delivering any kind of web content either through  
  CloudFront distributions, Amazon API Gatewa REST APIs, ALBs or via AWS AppSync GraphQL APIs.

- Without using WAF, you could be exposing your websites and web apps to potentially harmful and mailcious traffic.

- The AWS Web Application Firewall is a service that helps to prevent websites or web applications from being  
  maliciously attacked by common web attack patterns. Many of which are outlined in the OWASP top 10 list, such as  
  SQL injection and cross-site scripting.

- There are two versions of AWS WAF

  - AWS WAF
  - AWS WAF Classic: Only use for resources created prior to november 2019.

- AWS WAF interacts with:

  - Amazon API Gateway
  - Cloudfront distributions
  - ALBs
  - AWS AppSync GraphQL API

- AWS WAF ensures that only filtered web requests that meet specific conditions are forwarded to services above.

### Components of WAF

- Web ACLs

  - Main building block of the WAF service.
  - Determines which web requests are safe, and which are not.
  - Web ACL contains _rules_, which contains specific controls and criteria checks that assess each web request  
    to determine whether it should be allowed or blocked. Also for each Web ACL, there is a default action that  
    traffic should take if the criteria set out in the rules are not met by the incoming request, and the options  
    for this are either allow or block.

- Rules

  - Consists of a specific statement(criteria).
  - If the inspected request matches the criteria set out in the statement, then that is considered a _match_.  
    The result of this _match_ can then follow an action of allow, block, or count.
  - Allow: The request is forwarded onto the resource.
  - Block: The request is dropped and a response is sent back to the requester, informing them that the request  
    was denied.
  - Count: Simply counts the number of matching requests.

- Rule Groups

  - A collection of Rules that you can apply to different Web ACLs.
  - AWS WAF also comes pre-configured with a number of AWS manageable groups that have been built and designed  
    to protect your resources against some common attack patterns.

- (1) User initiates a request.
- (2) The request will be received by the **CloudFront distribution first**.
- (3) The request is forwarded to your associated WAF web ACL.
- (4) The web ACL would filter the incoming web traffic using the rules or rule groups.
- (5) If the request should be blocked, then the traffic would be stopped and prevented from progressing further.
- (6) If it is allowed to pass, then the request would be forwarded to CloudFront.
- (7) CloudFront would then serve the content as required.

## Understanding Rules and Rule Groups

### Managed Rule Groups

- Essentially a set of predefined rules that have already been created by AWS or other AWS marketplace sellers for  
  you to use.

- Benefits of using managed rule groups.
  - Rule groups are tried and tested.
  - Designed to protect against specific vulnerabilities.
  - Saves time and effort.

### Capacity

- For each ACL, there is a limit of 1500 capacity units known as WCUs, and this can be used by Rules and Rule Groups.
- Capacity can used by rules and rule groups. These WCUs are used to control the amount of operating resources that are  
  needed by AWS WAF to run your rules and the inspection criteria set out by those rules.

- WCU consumption depends on the rule and its complexity of statements.

  - The more intricate the rule is, the more WCUs will be consumed.

- When creating a rule group, you must stipulate an **immutable capacity** at the time of its creation.  
  This will then set the maximum WCUs that the rules within the group can reach.  
  This is because when you alter the rules within a rule group, it ensures that it doesn't exceed the maximum WCUs  
  of 1500, set out within any web ACLs that are sharing that rule group.

  - By ensuring that rule groups have an immutable WCU unit limit set, it would prevent your web ACLs from failing  
    if the rules within the rule group were modified. Any changes to the rule group would have to ensure that the  
    combined rule WCU remained at or below the immutable limit set.

### Custom Rules

- Firstly select a **Rule type**.
  - IP Set: Allows you to create a criteria based upon either the source IP address or the IP address in header.
  - Rule Builer
    - Need to define the rule type, which can either be regular or rate-based.
      - Rate-based rules count the number of requests that are being received based on the source IP address,  
        or the IP address in the header over a time period of five minutes.
      - Only actions allowed on rate-based rules are either _block_ or _count_.
  - Rule Group

### Rule Priority

- During both of their configurations, the web ACL or rule group, you'll be asked to verify the rule priorities  
  of the rules that have been added. And this is an important point as rules are executed in the order that they  
  are listed. So be careful to architect this order correctly for your rule base.

- Typical orders

  - (1) Whitelisted IPS: Allowed
  - (2) Blacklisted IPs: Blocked
  - (3) Bad Signatures: Rules that relate to attack patterns such as SQL injections and XSS vulnerabilities.

- As soon as the request matches all the criteria within a rule, the associated action will be carried out for that  
  rule, regardless of it there is another rule further down that would also be a match.
