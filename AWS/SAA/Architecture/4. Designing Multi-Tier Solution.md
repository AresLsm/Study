# Designing Multi-Tier Solution

## Architecture Basics

### LAMP

- A common tool stack used for building web services.
  - L: Linux Operating System
  - A: Apache Web Server
  - M: MySQL Database
  - P: PHP Programming Language

### MEAN

- An evolving stack pattern
  - M: MongoDB
  - E: ExpressJS
  - A: AngularJS
  - N: NodeJS

### Serverless

- Very beneficial in multi-tiered designs.
- Generally use Amazon API Gateway, AWS Lambda to replace logic tier.

### Microservices

- With microservice pattern, each of the application components is decoupled and independently deployed and operated.
- We still have to often consider tiers - especially when refactoring monolithic applications to run on microservices.

### What is Multi-Tier Architecture?

- Consists of:

  - Presentation Tier
  - Logic Tier
  - Data Tier

- Multi-tier architecture provides a general framework to ensure decoupled and independently scalable application  
  components can be developed, managed, and maintained separately.

- AWS makes it possible to make our multi-tier designs highly available by distributing our application tiers  
  across multiple availability zones. So what this means is that each of your tiers can be set up to run on up  
  to four distinct availability zones. Multi-tiers, running across multiple availability zones, provides us  
  with a highly available, scalable, resilient architecture.
