# Encryption Mechanisms

## Overview of Encryption Mechanisms

### Server-Side Encryption with S3 managed keys(SSE-S3)

- Requires minimal configuration.
- Management of encryption keys are managed by AWS.
- All you need to do is to upload your data, and S3 will handle all other aspects.

### Server-Side Encryption with KMS managed keys(SSE-KMS)

- Allows S3 to use KMS to generate data encryption keys
- Gives greater flexibility of key management:
  - Disabling, Rotating, and applying access controls to the CMKs.

### Server-Side Encryption with Customer provided keys(SSE-C)

- Gives you the opportunity to provide your own master keys.
- Your customer provided key would be sent with your data to S3, where S3 would then perform the encryption for you.

### Client-Side Encryption with KMS managed keys(CSE-KMS)

- Uses KMS to generate data encryption keys.
- KMS is called upon via the client, not by S3.
- Encryption takes place at the client-side and the encrypted data is then sent to S3.

### Client-Side Encryption with Customer provided keys(CSE-C)

- You are able to utilize your own provided keys.
- Use an AWS SDK Client to encrypt your data before sending it to S3 for storage.
