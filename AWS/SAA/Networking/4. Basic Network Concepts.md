# Basic Network Concepts

## Elastic IP Addresses(EIP)

- Elastic IP는 AWS에서 제공해주는 public ip address이다.
- EIP는 instance가 아닌 계정에 종속되며 하나의 리소스에서 다른 리소스로 이동시킬 수 있다.

  - AWS에게 release하지 않으면 아무런 instance에 attach되어 있지 않아도 과금된다.

- If you associate an EIP to an instance that already has a pooled public IP address,  
  that pooled IP address will be released and put back into the pool and your instance will take on the EIP address.

- You can't convert an existing pooled public IP address to an EIP.

- General pooled pulbic IP address는 instance가 종료되면 release되고, 재시작되면 새로운 IP 주소를 할당받는 반면  
  EIP를 instance에 attach하면 instance가 stop되든 재시작되든 동일한 EIP 주소를 유지한다.

## Elastic Network Interfaces(ENIs)

- The configuration is bound to the ENI and not the instance that it is attached to.  
  This means that you can also detach your ENI from one instance, and reconnect it to another instance  
  and the configuration of that ENI would move with it. For example, a private IP address or an elastic IP address  
  or it's MAC address.

- When designing your solution and any requirements for multiple interfaces being attached to your instances,  
  you'll need to bear in mind that the quantity of interfaces is dependent on the EC2 instance type.

- ENI는 하나의 instance가 2개 이상의 subnet 내에서 있는 것처럼 하는 데 사용된다.

## EC2 Enhanced Networking with the Elastic Network Adapter(ENA)

- ENA(Elastic Network Adapter) is a customer interface used to optimize network performance.

  - ex) If you are looking to enable enhanced networking features to reach speeds of up to 100 Gbps for your  
    Linux compute instances, then you can do so using an ENA.

- ENAs are only supported on a limited number of instances.

- In addition to 100 Gbps speed, enhanced networking offers higher bandwidth with increased PPS(Packet Per Second) performance.
- A big bonnus of enhanced networking is that it is offered at no extra cost.
- When launching an instance using Amazon Linux 2 or with the latest version of the Amazon Linux AMI,  
  then the instance will have enhanced networking enabled by default.

## VPC Endpoints

- VPC Endpoints allow you to privately access AWS services using the AWS internal network instead of connecting to  
  such services via the internet using public DNS endpoints.

  - This means that you can connect to the supported services without configuring an Internet Gateway,  
    NAT Gateway, a Virtual Private Network or a Direct Connect connection.

### Interface Endpoints

- Interface Endpoints are essentially ENIs that are placed within a subnet that act as a target for any traffic  
  that is being sent to a supported services and operates through the use of PrivateLink.

  - PrivateLink allows a private and secure connection between VPCs, AWS services, and on-premises applications,  
    via the AWS internal network.

- One point to make is that when an interface endpoint is configured within your chosen subnet,  
  the service that it is associated with is NOT able to initiate a connection through to your VPC,  
  communication across this interface HAS to originate from within your VPC first before a response can be made by the service.

- When an interface endpoint is created for a service, a specific DNS hostname is created and is associated  
  with a private hosted zone in your VPC.

- Within this hosted zone a record set for the default DNS name of the service is created resolving to the  
  IP address of your interface endpoint.

- As a result, any applications using that service already does not need to be reconfigured.

- Requests to that service using the default DNS name will now be resolved to the private IP address of the  
  interface endpoint and will route through the internal AWS network instead of the internet.

### Gateway Endpoints

- A Gateway Endpoint is a target that is used within your route tables to allow you to reach supported services.

- During the creation of your Gateway endpoint you will be asked which route tables within your VPC should be  
  updated to add the new Target of the gateway endpoint.

- Any route table selected with then have a route automatically added to include the new Gateway Endpoint.

- The entry of the route will have a prefix list ID of the associated service (Amazon S3 or DynamoDB) and  
  the target entry will be the VPC Endpoint ID.
