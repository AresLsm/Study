# Design Patterns

## Principles of Design Patterns

- Motivation: To make reusable software assets to reduce software cost and increase productivity and software quality.

### Design Patterns

- To represent solutions to problems that arise when developing software within a particular context.
- To capture the **static and dynamic structure** and collaboration among key participants in software designs.

### Classifications of Design Patterns

- Creational Patterns: Deal with initializing and configuring classes and objects.
  - Factory Method Pattern, Builder Pattern
- Structural Patterns: Deal with decoupling interface and implmentation of classes and objects.
  - Adapter Pattern
- Behavioral Patterns: Deal with dynamic interactions among societies of classes and objects.

### Principles of Design Patterns

- (1) Seperate interface from implementation.
- (2) Allow substitution of variable implementations via a common interface.
- (3) Determin what is _common_ and what is _variable_ with an interface and an implementation.
  - Common <=> stable
  - Variable <=> Unstable, to be resolved.
  - OCP(Open Closed Principle): Determining common vs variable features.
    - Components should be:
      - The design of **variable** features should be **open** for customization and extension.
      - The design of **common** features should be **closed** for modification.

### Benefits of Design Patterns

- Utilizing expert knowledge.
- Promoting effective communication among developers.
- Assisting better qualtiy object-oriented design with:
  - High modularity.
  - High readability.
  - High modifiability.
  - High extensibility.

## Factory Method

- Define an **interface** for creating an object, but let **subclasses decide which class to instantiate**.
- Factory Method lets a class defer instantiation to subclasses.

- Factory method is called in a method of super-class, but is implemented differntly in sub-classes.
  - Gives great extendibility.

- `Product`: Define the interface for the type of objects the factory method creates.
- `ConcreteProduct`: Implements the `Product` interface.
- `Creator`: Declares the factory method, which returns an object of type `Product`.
- `ConcreteCreator`: Overrides the factory method to return an instance of `ConcreteProduct`.

### Collaborations

- `Creator` relies on its sub-classes to implement the factory method, so that it returns an instance of the  
  appropriate `ConcreteProduct`.

### Consequences

- Advantages
  - Code is made more **flexible** and **reusable** by the elemination of instantiation of application-specific classes.
  - Code deals only with the **interface** of the `Product`.
- Disadvantages
  - Clients might have to subclass the `Creator` class just to instantiate a particular `ConcreteProduct`,  
    which might be a little bit complicated.

## Adapter

- Convert the interface of a class into another interface that clients expect.
  - Adapter lets classes work together that couldn't otherwise because of incompatible interfaces.

### Motivation

- Sometimes a toolkit or class library cannot be used because its interface is incompatible with the interface  
  required by an application.

  - We can not change the library interface.
  - Even if we can change it, we probably shouldn't.

- Two approaches

  - Class Adapter: **Inherits** an adapter and an adaptee.
  - Object Adapter: Composes an **adaptee instance** within an adapter and implement the adapter in terms of the adaptee's interface.

- A solution using an Object Adapter.

### Applicability

- Use the adapter pattern when:

  - To use an existing class, and its interface does not match the one you need.

### Structure: Class Adapter.

![picture 30](/images/OTHERS_TMP_SE_7.png)

- A Class Adapter uses **multiple inheritance to adapt one interface to another**.

#### Consequences: Class Adapter

- Advantages
  - Lets Adapter override some of Adaptee's behavior, since Adapter is a subclass of Adaptee.
  - Introduces only one object, and no additional pointer indirection is needed to get to the adaptee.
- Disadvantages
  - Will not work to adapt a class and all its subclasses.

### Structure: Object Adapter

![picture 31](/images/OTHERS_TMP_SE_8.png)

- An Object Adapter relies on object composition.

#### Collaborations

- Clients call operations on an **Adapter instance.**
- The **Adapter calls Adaptee operations** that carry out the request.

#### Consequences: Object Adapter

- Advantages
  - Lets a single Adapter to work with many Adaptees.
- Disadvantages
  - Makes it harder to override Adaptee's behavior.

## Builder

- Seperate the construction of a complex object from its representation, so that the **same construction process can**  
  **create different representations.**
- Allow for the **dynamic creation of objects** based upon easily interchangeable algorithms.

### Applicability

- Use the Builder Pattern when:
  - The process for creating a complex object should be independent of the parts that make up the object, and how  
    they are assembled.
  - The construction process should allow different representations for the object that is created.
  - Runtime control over the construction process is needed.

### Structure

![picture 32](/images/OTHERS_TMP_SE_9.png)

### Participants

- `Builder`: Specifies an abstract interface for creating parts of a `Product` object.
- `ConcreteBuilder`: Constructs and assembles parts of the `Produc` by implementing the `Builder` interface.
- `Director`: Constructs an object using the `Builder` interface.
- `Product`: Represents the complex object under construction.

### Collaborations

- (1) The client creates the `Director` object and configures it with the desired `Builder` object.
  - `val director = Director(ConcreteBuilder())`
- (2) `Director` notifies the `Builder` whenever a part of the `Product` should be built.
  - `director.construct()`
- (3) `Builder` handles requests from the `Director` and adds parts to the `Product`.
  - `builder.buildPart()`
- (4) The client retrieves the `Product` from the `Builder`.
  - `val product = director.getResult()`

### Consequences

- Lets you vary a `Product`'s internal representation.
- Isolates code for construction and representation.
- Gives you finer control over the construction process.
