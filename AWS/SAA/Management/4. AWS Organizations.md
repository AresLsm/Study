# AWS Organizations

## Overview of AWS Organizations

- With AWS Organizations you can provide a means of centrally managing and categorizing multiple AWS accounts that  
  you own, bringing them together into a single organization, which helps to maintain your AWS environment from a  
  security, compliance, and account management perspective.

### Components

#### Organizations

- Organization is an element that serves to form a hierarchical structure of multiple AWS accounts.

#### Root

- The Root object is simply a container that resides at the top of your Organization.  
  All of your AWS accounts and Organizational Units will then sit underneath this Root.  
  Within any Organization, there will only be one single Root object.

#### Organization Units

- Organizational Units (OUs) provide a means of categorizing your AWS Accounts.  
  Again, like the Root, these are simply containers that allow you to group together specific AWS accounts.  
  An OU can connect directly below the Root or even below another OU (which can be nested up to 5 times).  
  This allows you to create a hierarchical structure.

#### Accounts

- Accounts are your AWS accounts that you use and create to be able to configure and provision AWS resources.  
  Each of your AWS accounts has a 12 digit account number.

#### Service Control Policies

- Service control policies, or SCPs, allow you to control what services and features are accessible from within  
  an AWS account. These SCPs can either be associated with the Root, Organizational Units, or individual accounts.  
  When an SCP is applied to any of these objects, its associated controls are fed down to all child objects.  
  Think of it as a permission boundary that sets the maximum permission level for the objects that it is applied to.

### Benefits of AWS Organizations

- Ability to centrally manage multiple accounts from a single AWS account(master account)
- Greater control of your AWS environment
  - Through the use of Service Control Policies attached to the Root, Organizational Units or individual accounts,  
    administrators of the master account gain powerful control over which services and features even down to specific  
    API calls that an IAM user within those accounts can use, regardless of the userâ€™s identity-based or  
    resource-based permissions.
- Consolidated billing
  - The master account of your AWS Organization can be used to consolidate the billing and costs from all member  
    AWS accounts, which allows for greater overall cost management across your individual AWS accounts.
- Categorization and grouping of accounts
  - By leveraging OUs, you can segregate and group specific AWS accounts together, applying different SCPs  
    associated to each OU.

## Implementing AWS Organizations

- Master account carries certain administrative level capabilities such as:

  - Creating additional AWS accounts within your organization
  - Inviting other accounts to join your organization
  - Removing AWS accounts from your organization
  - Applying security features via policies to different levels within your organization

- Once you have selected your **AWS account to be used as a master account**, you can create an AWS Organization.  
  From here, you have two choices when creating an organization type:
  - Enable all features
    > If you want to set up service control policies, then you need to select enable all features.
  - Enable only consolidated billing

## Securing your organization with Service Control Policies

- SCPs are different from both identity-based and resource-based policies, which grant permissions to users,  
  groups, and roles. However, SCPs do not actually grant permission themselves. Restrictions made within an SCP  
  set a boundary of permissions for AWS accounts.

- SCP would serve to prevent that service from being used within the AWS account and so have the overriding  
  precedence and determine the maximum level of permissions allowed.

- SCP does not grant access. They add a guardrail to define what is allowed. You will still need to configure your  
  identity-based or resource-based policies to identities, granting permission to carry out actions within your accounts.

### Characteristics of SCP

- SCPs do not affect resource-based policies. They only affect principals managed by your accounts in your organization.
- SCPs affect all users and roles, in addition to the root user. However, the root user will still be able to  
  change its own password including MFA settings, manage root access keys, and manage x.509 keys for the root user.
- If you disable SCPs in your organization, all SCPs are deleted and removed.  
  Re-enabling SCPs again in the same organization will revert to the default SCP allowing FullAWSAccess.

- The following are not affected by SCPs:
  - Any actions performed by the master account.
  - SCPs do not affect service-linked roles.
  - Managing Amazon CloudFront keys.
