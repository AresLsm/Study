# AWS Logging

## CloudWatch Logging Agent

- CloudWatch is used to collate and collect metrics on resources, monitor their performance and response to alerts.
- CloudWatch allows you to collect logs of your applications and a number of different AWS services.
- CloudWatch provides the ability to monitor log streams in real time and set up metric filters to search  
  for specific events.

### Unified CloudWatch Agent

- Unified CloudWatch Agent allows the collection of logs from EC2 instances as well from on-premise servers.

### CloudWatch Agent Installation

- (1) Create a role and attach it to the instance with permissions to collect data from the instances in addition  
  to interacting with SSM.
- (2) Download nad install the agent onto the EC2 instance.
- (3) Configure and start the CloudWatch agent.

#### Creating Roles

- Two roles are required:

  - (1) Used to install the agent and also send the additional metrics gathereed to CloudWatch.
  - (2) Used to communicate with the Parameter Store within SSM, to store a configuration information file of  
    the agent.

#### Configuring the agent

- On your first instance, you need to create the CloudWatch Agent Configuration File.

  - This file stores configuration parameters that specify which metrics and logs to capture on the instance.
  - It can be created manually or by using a wizard.
  - It is in JSON format.

- Configuration file을 SSM에 저장시켜 하나의 configuration file을 여러 개의 EC2 instance가 공유할 수 있다.
