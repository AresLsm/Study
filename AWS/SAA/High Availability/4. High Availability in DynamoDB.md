# High Availability in DynamoDB

## AWS DynamoDB HA Options

- AWS DynamoDB

  - NoSQL schemaless managed service
  - Built and provided by AWS
  - Designed internally to automatically partition data and incoming traffic across **multiple partitions**
  - Partitions are stored on **numerous backend servers** distributed across **3 AZs** within a single region.

- DynamoDB takes care of performing both the partition management and replication for you.
- The synchronous AZ replication provides protection against any single node outage and/or a full AZ outage.
- The synchronous replication takes place using low latency interconnections between each of the AZs  
  within a region and ensures high speed sub second replication.

### Global Tables

- DynamoDB provides a secondary layer of availability in the form of cross-region replication.
- A Global Table gives you the capability to replicate a single table across 1 or many alternate regions.
- A Global Table elevates the availability of your data and enables applications to take advantage of data locality.
- Users can be served data directly from the closest geographicaly located table replica.

> You cannot configure Global Table in different AWS accounts.

- Global Tables implement multi-master read/write capability with eventual consistency.
- Both read, writes can be performed against any one of the configured global tables.
- All writes will then be replicated in near sub second time to all other globally configured tables of the same  
  table name.

> Existing DynamoDB tables can be converted into Global Tables later on.

## On-Demand Backup and Restore

- On Demand Backups

  - Allows you to request a full backup of a table, as it is at the very moment of the backup request is made.
  - On demand backups are manually requested, and can be peformed either through the AWS DynamoDB Console or by  
    using the AWS CLI.

- On Demand Backups are useful in the following scenarios:

  - Table corruption(rare, but possible)
  - Long term regulatory, compliance, and/or auditing data requirements.
  - Testing scenarios.

- Scheduling on demand backups provides you with the ability to restore table data back to a point in time.
- On demand backups remain in the account, until they are explicitly requested to be deleted by an administrator.
- **Backups typically finish within seconds**, and have zero impact on the table performance and availability.

> New table is created in 2-5 minutes with data from the backup.

## Point in Time Recovery(PITR)

- Point In Time Recovery or PITR - is an enhanced version of the on-demand backup and restore feature,  
  providing you with the ability to perform point in time recoveries.

- This feature is extremely handy in situations when you’re modifying data and want a safety net in place  
  for the situation where your data modifications didn’t result in the way they should have.

- PITR takes the burden away of having to plan backup schedules, etc.

- PITR

  - Operators at the **table level** and provides you with the ability to performa a point in time recovery  
    for anytime between the current time and the last 35 days.

  - This feature needs to be enabled, as it is disabled by default.  
    Once enabled you can request a recovery by specifying a date and time with second precision or granularity.

  - The restoration will **always** be performed into a new table.

  - Table restoration can be performed in the same region as the original table, or into a different region  
    all together.
