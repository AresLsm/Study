### On-demand Instances

- Can be launched at any time.
- Able to be provisioned and available within minutes.
- Use an instance for any duration before terminating.

### On-demand Instances(BYOL - Bring Your Own License)

- Currently, BYOL license options are only available with the Oracle DB Engine.

> On-demand instances already have software license included in the price.

- Charged by the hour with no long-term commitments of any sort.

### Reserved Instances

- Allow you to purchase a discount for an instance type with **set criteria** for a **set period of time**  
  in return for a reduced cost compared to on-demand instances.

  - This reduction can be much as 75%.
  - Must be purchased in 1 or 3 year time frames.

- More cost saving can happen depending on payment methods.

  - All upfront: Largest discount
  - Partial upfront
  - No upfront

## Database Storage and I/O pricing

- MySQL, MariaDB, PostgreSQL, Oracle, SQL Server all use EBS volumes for both data and log storage.
- Aurora uses shard cluster architecture and does not use EBS.

- Below are different types of Database Engines using EBS

### General Purpose SSD

- Broad range of usage.
- Low latencies.
- Cost-effective solution.

- You are chared for the amount of storage provisioned, and not for the numbers of I/Os processed.

### Provisioned IOPS(SSD) Storage

- Great for high I/O workloads.

- Charged based upon the amount of storage provisioned in addition to the IOPS throughput selected.  
  Also not charged for total numbers of I/Os processed.

### Magnetic Storage

- Supported to provide backwards compatibility.
- AWS recommends that you select General Purpose Strage SSD instead.

### Aurora Storage

- The pricing metric used is GB-Month, in addition to the **actual numbers of I/Os processed** , which  
  are billed per **million requests.**

#### Benefits of Aurora

- You are only billed for storage used and I/Os processed.
- The other DB engines bill you for storage provisioned, regardless of how much is actually used.

### Pricing Structure for the Storage

- The costs for your database storage has 2 different price points depending on whether it has been configured  
  as a single-AZ or Multi-AZ deployment. Much like the instance pricing, the Multi-AZ is typically twice the  
  value of single-AZ deployment.

- All storage types come at a different price.  
  For each type of storage used, it is priced at per GB-Month.

## Backup Storage pricing

- Amazon RDS does not charge any backup storage costs that equate to the total sum of privisioned storage used  
  with your databases within a specific region.

### Things to consider

- Any automated backups taken use of backup storage.
- Any manual snapshots that are taken of your database will also use backup storage.
- By extending your backup retention periods (how long youâ€™d like to keep your backups for) will increase the  
  amount of storage required for backups.
- Backup storage is calculated based upon the total amount of backup storage consumed within a specific region  
   across all your RDS databases.
- If you copy your backups to another region, this will also increase the amount of backup storage used within that new region.

---

## Backtrack Storage pricing

- `Backtrack` is a feature which is currently only available for a MySQL-compatible Aurora Database.  
  This allows you to go back in time on the database to recover from an error or incident,  
  without having to perform a restore or create another DB cluster.

---

## Snapshot Export pricing

- Snapshots in RDS are backups for your database tables and instances.
- These snapshots can be exported out of RDS, to S3.
- Snapshots can be used to perform analysis of the data held within your database using more specific tools,  
  such as Amazon Athena.
- During an export of a snapshot, you can decide, through filtering, to simply export specific databases,  
  tables, or even schemas.
- The cost associated with performing snapshot exports are based on a region by region basis.
  - Also chared for S3 storage and Put requests.

---

## Data Transfer pricing

- Data transfer charges:

  - Data transferred IN to your RDS database from the internet. (NOT CHARGED)
  - Data transferred OUT from your RDS database to the internet.
  - Data transferred OUT to Amazon CloudFront. (NOT CHARGED)
  - Data transferred OUT to AWS Regions.
  - Data transferred OUT to EC2 instances in the same availability zone. (NOT CHARGED)
  - Data transferred between availability zones for multi-az replication. (NOT CHARGED)
  - Data transferred between an EC2 instance and an RDS instance in different availability zones of the same region.
  - Data transferred when a snapshot copy is transferred to a different region.
