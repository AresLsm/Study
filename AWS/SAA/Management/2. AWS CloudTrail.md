# AWS CloudTrail

## What is AWS CloudTrail?

- Records and tracks all API requests in your AWS account.
- Requests can be initiated from:
  - SDKs
  - AWS CLI
  - AWS Management Console
  - Another AWS Service

### CloudTrail Events

- Every API request captured is recorded as an _'event'_ and is recorded within a log file, which is then  
  stored on S3.

- Multiple events are recorded within CloudTrail Logs.
- Events contain an array of associated metadata, for example:
  - Identity of the caller.
  - Timestamp of request.
  - Source IP address.

### CloudTrail Logs

- New log files are created every 5 minutes.
- Log files are delivered and stored witin S3.
- Log files can be stored for as long as required allowing you to review the history of all API requests.
- CloudTrail Log files can also be delivered to CloudWatch Logs for metric monitoring and alerting via SNS.

### CloudTrail Infrastructure

- CloudTrail is a global service, supporting ALL regions.
- Support for over 60 AWS services and features.

### Use Cases for captured data

- Effective for security analysis.

  - Monitor restricted API calls.
  - Notification of threshold breaches.

- Resolve day to day operational issues.

  - Filtering mechanisms for isolating data.
  - Quicker root cause identification.
  - Speedy resolution.

- Able to track changes to your AWS infrastructure.

- CloudTrail logs can be used as evidence for various compliance and governance controls.

  - ISO, PCI DSS, FedRamp etc.

## AWS CloudTrail Operations

### Core Features & Services

- Trails: These are the building blocks of the service.  
  You can create many different Trails containing different configurations related to API requests that you want to capture.

- S3: S3 is used by default to store the CloudTrail log files and a dedicated S3 bucket is required during the  
  creation of a new Trail.

- Logs: Logs are created by AWS CloudTrail and record all events captured.  
  A new log file is created approximately every five minutes and once processed, it is delivered to an S3 bucket  
  as defined by its Trail configuration. If no API calls have been made, then no logs will be delivered.

- KMS: The use of AWS KMS is an optional element of CloudTrail, but it allows additional encryption to be added  
  to your log files when stored on S3.

- SNS: SNS is also an optional component for CloudTrail, but it allows for you to create notifications.  
  For example, when a new log file is delivered to S3, SNS could notify someone or a team via an email,  
  or it could be used in conjunction with CloudWatch, when metric thresholds have been reached.

- CloudWatch logs: Another optional component. For AWS CloudTrail this allows you to deliver its logs to AWS  
  as CloudWatch logs, as well as S3 for specific monitoring metrics to take place.

- Events Selectors: Events Selectors allow to add a level of customization to the type of API requests,  
  you want the corresponding trails to capture.

- Tags: Tags allow you to assign your own metadata to your Trail.  
  For example, you could add a project or department tag indicating which project or department the trail relates to.

- Events: For every API request that is captured by CloudTrail it is recorded as an event in a CloudTrail log file.

- API Activity Filters: Search filters that can be applied against your API activity history in the management  
  console for create, modify and delete API calls. These events are held in the management console for seven days,  
  even if the Trails itself is stopped or deleted.

### CloudTrail Process Flow

- (1) Create a trail.

  - (1) Specify an S3 Bucket for log storage.
  - (2): (Optional) Encrypt log files with KMS.
  - (3): (Optional) Configure SNS for notifications of new log files.
  - (4): (Optional) Enable log file validation.
  - (5) Create Trail.
  - (6) (Optional) Deliver CloudTrail Logs to CloudWatch for monitoring.
  - (7) (Optional) Configure Event Selectors
  - (8) (Optional) Add any required tags.
  - (9) Configuration Complete.

- For every API call that matches the requirement of your Trail, it will be captured and recorded in a log file  
  as an event. Each API call will be recorded as a new event. Once you've captured the data, you may need to  
  find a particular event quickly, maybe for security reasons. This can be achieved using API Activity Filters,  
  which can be found within the CloudTrail service from the management console.
