# Designing Multi-Tier Solution

## Architecture Basics

### LAMP

- A common tool stack used for building web services.
  - L: Linux Operating System
  - A: Apache Web Server
  - M: MySQL Database
  - P: PHP Programming Language

### MEAN

- An evolving stack pattern
  - M: MongoDB
  - E: ExpressJS
  - A: AngularJS
  - N: NodeJS

### Serverless

- Very beneficial in multi-tiered designs.
- Generally use Amazon API Gateway, AWS Lambda to replace logic tier.

### Microservices

- With microservice pattern, each of the application components is decoupled and independently deployed and operated.
- We still have to often consider tiers - especially when refactoring monolithic applications to run on microservices.

### What is Multi-Tier Architecture?

- Consists of:

  - Presentation Tier
  - Logic Tier
  - Data Tier

- Multi-tier architecture provides a general framework to ensure decoupled and independently scalable application  
  components can be developed, managed, and maintained separately.

- AWS makes it possible to make our multi-tier designs highly available by distributing our application tiers  
  across multiple availability zones. So what this means is that each of your tiers can be set up to run on up  
  to four distinct availability zones. Multi-tiers, running across multiple availability zones, provides us  
  with a highly available, scalable, resilient architecture.

## What is Multi-Tier Design and when should we use it?

- Multi-Tier Architecture

  - Each layer is independent of the other layers.
  - Each layer can be scaled up or down to meet specific demand.
  - 3-Tier architectuer is the most common multi-tier architecture.

- N-Tier Design

  - Services can run on EC2 instances, serverless functions and more.

- Tiers could be different services or technologies. The name of a tier or even the type of technology used in it  
  isn't really important. The reason for wanting to separate out the layers is so that each can operate and scale  
  independently of the other.

### Benefits of Multi-Tier Architecture

- If one layer becomes overwhelmed:
  - It does not impact the other tiers.
  - We can increase the resources available without having to scale every tier.
- Service tiers are decoupled.
- Tiers can scale in and out to meet demand.
- The capacity of scaling is near unlimited on AWS infrastructure.

## When should we consider Single-Tier Architecture?

- Single-Tier generally implies that all the replication services are running on the same machine or instances.
- **All the services use same machine, same resoures.**

### When to choose Single-Tier over Multi-Tier?

- Ideal for simple, non-customer facing solutions.
- Dev/Test environments.
- Predictable, low traffic servers.

### Single-Tier design

- Can use multiple AZs.
- Can use auto scaling.
- Can make your single-tier architecture more resilient.
- Doest **not** decouple your services so they can be scaled **independently.**

> If you are asked to make an application highly available and fault tolerant, you will need to  
> refactor it as a multi-tier architecture.

## Designing a Multi-Tier Solution

### AZs(Availability Zones)

- Up to 4 AZs - Depending on the region.
- Using more than one AZ increases the resilience and availability of your solution.
- Using more than one AZ increases your ability to recover a solution if there is a disaster.

### VPC Subnets

- A subnet can be either public or private.

  - It is public if it has an internet gateway and a route to that internet gateway.
  - If it doesn't have a route to an internet gateway, then it is a private subnet.
  - Public subnets have default route table - enables us to allow inbound and outbound traffic.
  - Private subnets need a route table to direct traffic flow within the VPC.
