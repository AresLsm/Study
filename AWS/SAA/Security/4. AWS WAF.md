# AWS WAF(Web Application Firewall)

## AWS WAF Overview

- AWS WAF can add an additional layer of security when delivering any kind of web content either through  
  CloudFront distributions, Amazon API Gatewa REST APIs, ALBs or via AWS AppSync GraphQL APIs.

- Without using WAF, you could be exposing your websites and web apps to potentially harmful and mailcious traffic.

- The AWS Web Application Firewall is a service that helps to prevent websites or web applications from being  
  maliciously attacked by common web attack patterns. Many of which are outlined in the OWASP top 10 list, such as  
  SQL injection and cross-site scripting.

- There are two versions of AWS WAF

  - AWS WAF
  - AWS WAF Classic: Only use for resources created prior to november 2019.

- AWS WAF interacts with:

  - Amazon API Gateway
  - Cloudfront distributions
  - ALBs
  - AWS AppSync GraphQL API

- AWS WAF ensures that only filtered web requests that meet specific conditions are forwarded to services above.

### Components of WAF

- Web ACLs

  - Main building block of the WAF service.
  - Determines which web requests are safe, and which are not.
  - Web ACL contains _rules_, which contains specific controls and criteria checks that assess each web request  
    to determine whether it should be allowed or blocked. Also for each Web ACL, there is a default action that  
    traffic should take if the criteria set out in the rules are not met by the incoming request, and the options  
    for this are either allow or block.

- Rules

  - Consists of a specific statement(criteria).
  - If the inspected request matches the criteria set out in the statement, then that is considered a _match_.  
    The result of this _match_ can then follow an action of allow, block, or count.
  - Allow: The request is forwarded onto the resource.
  - Block: The request is dropped and a response is sent back to the requester, informing them that the request  
    was denied.
  - Count: Simply counts the number of matching requests.

- Rule Groups

  - A collection of Rules that you can apply to different Web ACLs.
  - AWS WAF also comes pre-configured with a number of AWS manageable groups that have been built and designed  
    to protect your resources against some common attack patterns.

- (1) User initiates a request.
- (2) The request will be received by the **CloudFront distribution first**.
- (3) The request is forwarded to your associated WAF web ACL.
- (4) The web ACL would filter the incoming web traffic using the rules or rule groups.
- (5) If the request should be blocked, then the traffic would be stopped and prevented from progressing further.
- (6) If it is allowed to pass, then the request would be forwarded to CloudFront.
- (7) CloudFront would then serve the content as required.
