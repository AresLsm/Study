# AWS IAM

## What is Identity & Access Management (IAM)?

### Identity & Access Management Defined

- **Identities** are required to authenticate AWS accounts.
- **Access Management** relates to authorization and access control.
  - Access Control
    - Username and Password
    - MFA(Multi-Factor Authentication)
    - Federated Access
  - Authorization
    - List of permissions: `S3:CreateBucket`, `RDSReadOnly`, `EC2FullAccess`, `CloudTrailFullAccess`

### IAM Components

- The IAM Service is used to manage and control security permissions.

- Users: Objects within IAM identifying different users.
- Groups: Objects that contain multiple users.
- Roles: Objects that different identities can adopt to assume a new set of permissions.
- Policy Permissions: JSON policies that define what resources can and can't be accessed.
- Access Control Mechanisms: Mechanisms that govern how a resource is accessed.

### IAM is a Global Service

- IAM covers all regions.

### IAM Service

- IAM is the first service a user will interact with when using AWS.

### Importance of IAM

- It is critical to understand IAM and know how to implement its features:

  - Without IAM, there is no way of maintaining security or control the access to your resources.
  - IAM provides the components to manage access, but it is only as strong as you configure it.
  - The responsibility of implementing secure, robust and tight security within IAM is yours!

### IAM Responsibility

- How secure your access control procedures must be?
- How much should you restrict users access?
- How complex a password policy must be?
- Should you use MFA?
