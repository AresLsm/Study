# Managing access using IAM user groups and roles

## Managing multiple users with IAM user groups

- It's best practice to apply permissions to groups, instead of users.
- Default maximum limit of groups: 300
- A user can only be associated with maximum of 10 groups.

- A group can be attached maximum of 10 different policies at once.

## IAM Roles

- IAM Roles allow trusted Users, AWS services and applications to adopt a set of temporary IAM credentials  
  to access your AWS resources.

- Roles act as identities, much like Users do, and have permissions assigned to them defining what resources  
  the Roles can and can't access.

- Unlike users, IAM Roles are designed to be assumed by multiple different entities as and when required.

- Roles are used for temporary access to gain access to resources, and each time the role is assumed by a User,  
  an AWS service or an application, a new set of credentials is dynamically created for the duration of that session.  
  As a result, Roles do not have any long term credentials associated, so there is no password for console access,  
  nor are there any access keys for programmatic access that are explicitly associated with the Role.

- Roles are generally uses in the following cases:

  - If you need to grant temporary access for Users to AWS resources that they don't normally require access to.
  - To grant access for an IAM User in one account to access resources in another AWS account
  - If an AWS service needs to access resources on your behalf or if an application requires access to resources.
  - To alllow access to specific resources for federated users.

- Roles can be assumed by the following:

  - A user that's in the same AWS account as the where the Role has been created.
  - User in a different AWS account than where the Role has been created.
  - AWS service (such as EC2)
  - External federated users to your AWS account.
