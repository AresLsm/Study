# KMS

## What is KMS?

### What is data encryption?

- Information is altered rendering plaintext data unreadable through mathematical algorithms and  
  encryption keys.

- An encryption key is required to revert the ciphertext back to plaintext.

- A key is a string of characters; the longer the key, the more robust the encryption.

- This encryption can be categorized by symmetric or asymmetric cryptography.

### Symmetric cryptography

- A **single key** is used to both encrypt and decrypt data.

- If the data was being reed by a different person, that person would need to be issued the same key.

- If the key is intercepted during the transmission, any data associated could be easily decrypted.

  - AWS KMS resolves this issue by acting as a central repository, governing and storing the keys required  
    and only issues the decryption keys to those who have sufficient permissions to do so.

- Some commoly used symmetric cryptography algorithms are:
  - AES
  - DES
  - Triple-DES
  - Blowfish

> AWS KMS only uses symmetric cryptography.

### KMS(Key Management Service)

- KMS is a managed service used to store and generate encryption keys that are used by other AWS services and applications.

  - For example, S3 may use the KMS to enable S3 to offer and perform server-side encryption using SSE-KMS.

- KMS contains the keys to decrypt your private data.

  - Administrators at AWS do not have access to your keys within KMS.
  - All administrative actions require dual authentication by two Amazon administrators.
  - It's our(customer) responsibility to administer our own encryption keys.

- KMS is for **encryption at rest**.  
  KMS does not perform encryption for data in transit or in motion.

#### Encryption at rest

- Server-side encryption

  - Encryption is done by the server.
  - Backend servers that encrypt the data as it arrives transparent to the end user.(ex. SSE-KMS)
  - The overhead of performing encryption and managing the keys is handled by the server.

- Client-side encryption

  - Encryption is done by the end user.
  - Requires the user to interact with the data to make the data encrypted.
  - The overhead of encryption process is on the client.

### Compliance and Regulations

- KMS works seamlessly with AWS CloudTrail to audit and track how your encryption keys are being used and by whom.
