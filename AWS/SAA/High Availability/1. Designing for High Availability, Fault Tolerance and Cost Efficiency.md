# Designing for High Availability, Fault Tolerance and Cost Efficiency

## Backup and Disaster Recovery strategies

- RTO(Recovery Time Objective): Defined as the maximum amount of time in which a service can remain unavailable  
  before it's classed as damaging to the business.

> RTO 내에 Disaster Recovery가 완료되어야 한다.

- RPO(Recovery Point Objective): Defined as the maximum amount of time for which a data could be lost for a service.

## High Availability vs Fault Tolerance

- High Availability: High Availability can be defined by maintaining a percentage of uptime which maintains  
  operational performance, and so this can closely be aligned to an SLA.

- Fault Tolerance: Fault Tolerance expands on High Availability to offer a greater level of protection should components  
  begin to fail in your infrastructure, however, there are usually additional cost implications due to the greater level  
  of resiliency offered.

- Fault Tolerance는 High Availability보다 상위 개념이다. (즉, Fault Tolerance가 높으면 당연히 High Availability를 갖는다.)

- Fault Tolerance를 갖추기 위해 AWS에서 생각해볼 만한 점은 2개 이상의 Region을 사용하는 것이다.  
  물론 하나의 region 내의 다른 2개 이상의 AZ를 사용하는 것도 가능하지만, 이는 High Availability를 위한 것이다.  
  Fault Tolerance는 이보다 한 단계 더 나아가 Region Level의 장애를 감내할 수 있다.

## Considerations when planning an AWS DR storage solution

### How to get data in/out of AWS?

- Direct Connect: Supports in/out activity up to 10 Gbps.
- VPN Connection
- Internet Connection

### Large Data Transfer

- Transfer of large data can be done by using physical disk appliances.

- AWS Snowball

  - Physical appliance sent to customer site.
  - 50TB or 80TB in size.
  - Use multiple Snowball appliances to scale to Petabyte scale.

- Snowmobile

  - Exabyte-scale transfer service.
  - Transfer up to 100PB per Snowmobile(pulled by a semi-trailer truck).

- AWS Storage Gateway

  - Another solution which acts as a gateway between your data center and your AWS environment.

### How quickly do you need you data back?

- Things to consider

  - Dependend on your RTO requirements.
  - How critical is the data to the business?
  - Different storage services offer different accessibility options.
  - Your network infrastructure to AWS will impact retrieval rates.

### How much data do you need to import/export?

- The amount of data you have to transfer can affect your storage solution.
- Calculate your target transfer rate
  - Target transfer rate: Length of time it would take you to perform a copy over your connection to AWS.
- Check limitations of storage services used, minimums and maximums, this varies between services,  
  such as S3, Storage Gateway and Snowball.

### Durability

### Security

- Do you have to comply with specific governance and compliance controls?
- What encryption methods are available for sensitive data, at rest and in transit?
- It is essential to understand all security controls available.
- Poor security could devastate and damage your business.

### Compliance

- AWS Artifact
  - Allows customers to access and review AWS Compliance Reports.
