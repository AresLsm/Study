# High Availability in RDS

## RDS Multi-AZ

### Multi-AZ means in RDS

- A feature that is used to help with resilience and business continuity.
- Multi-AZ configures a secondary RDS instance(replica) within a differen AZ in the same region as the primary instance.
- The only purpose of Multi-AZ is to provide a failover option for a primary RDS instance.

> **It's not to be used as a secondary replica to offload read-only traffic to.** => **Not Read-Replica!!**

- The replication of data happens synchronously.
- RDS uses a failover mechanism on Oracle, MySQL, MariaDB, and PostgreSQL instances.
- The RDS failover process happens automatically, and is managed by AWS.

- RDS updates the DNS record to point to the secondary instance within 60-120 seconds.

- The failover process will happen in the following scenarios on the primary instance:
  - Patching maintenance
  - Host failure
  - AZ failure
  - Instance rebooted with Failover
  - DB instance class is modified

### SQL Server Multi-AZ

- SQL Server Multi-AZ is achived through the use of SQL Server Mirroring.

  - Multi-AZ is available only for some version of SQL Server.
  - SQL Mirroring provisions a secondary RDS instance in a seprate AZ than that of the primary RDS instance  
    to help with resilience and fault tolerance.
  - Both primary and secondary instances in SQL Server Mirroring use the same endpoint.

- You need to ensure you have your environment configured correctly.

  - A DB subnet group must be configured with a minimum of 2 different AZ's within it.
  - You can specify which AZ the standby mirrored instance will reside in.

### Amazon Aurora DB

- Amazon Aurora is different to the previous DB engines when it comes to resiliency across more than a single AZ.
  - Aurora DB Clusters are fault tolerant by default.
  - This is achieved within the cluster by replicating the data across different instances in different AZs.
  - Aurora can automatically provision and launch a new primary instance in the event of failure, which can take up to  
    10 minutes.
  - Multi-AZ on an Aurora Cluster allows RDS to provision a replica within a different AZ automatically.
  - Should a failure occur, the replica instance is promoted to the new primary instance without having to wait 10 mins.
  - This creates a highly available and resilient database solution.
  - It is possible to create up to 15 replicas if required, each with a different priority.

## Read Replicas

- Read replicas are NOT used for resiliency or as secondary instance in the event of a failover.
- Read replicas are used to serve read-only access to your database data via a seperate instance.

- Read replica orders

  - A snapshot is taken from your database.(Secondary instance if Multi-AZ is enabled)
  - Once the snapshot is completed, a read replica instance is created.
  - The read replica maintains a secure asynchronous link between itself and the primary database.
  - At this point, read-only traffic can be redirected to the read replica.
  - Read replicas are only available for MySQL, MariaDB and PostgreSQL DB engines.

- It is possible to deploy more than one read replica for a primary DB.
- Adding more replicas allows you to scale your read performance to a wider range of applications.
- You are able to deploy read replicas in different regions
- It is also possible to promote an existing read replica to replace the primary DB in the event of an incident.
- During any maintenance of the primary instance, read traffic can be served via your read replicas.

### Read Replicas on MySQL

- Read replicas are only supported where the source DB is running MySQL 5.6 or later.
- The retention value of the automatic backups of the primary DB needs to set to a value of 1 or more.
- Replication is also only possible when using an InnoDB storage engine, which is transactional.

- It is also possible to have nested read replica chains.
  - A read replica replicates from your source DB and can then act as a source DB for another read replica.
  - This chain can only be a maximum of 4 layers deep.
  - The same prerequisites must also apply to the source read replica.
  - You can have up to a maximum of 5 read replicas per each source DB.

- If an outage occurs with the primary instance, RDS automatically redirects the read replica source to the  
  secondary DB.

### Read Replicas on MariaDB

- For the MariaDB engine type, much of the information remains the same as per MySQL read replica limitations.
  - You still need to have the backup retention period greater than zero, and again, you can only have five read replicas  
    per source database.
  - The same read replicas nesting rules apply and you also have the same monitoring metric for CloudWatch,  
    however, you can be running ANY version of MariaDB for read replicas when running this DB engine.

### Read Replicas on PostgreSQL

- The automatic backup retention value needs to be greater than 0 and the limitation of read replicas is 5 per source DB.
- When using PostgreSQL, you need to run version 9.3.5 or later for read replicas.
- The native PostgreSQL streaming replication is used to handle replication and creation of the read replica.
- The connection between the master and the read replica instance replicats data asynchronously between the 2 instances.

- PostgreSQL allows you to create a Multi-AZ read replica instance.
- PostgreSQL does not allow nested read replicas.
