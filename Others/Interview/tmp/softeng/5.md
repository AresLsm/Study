# Introduction to Software Architecture

## Software Architecture

- System fundamental **concepts** or **properties** of a system in its environment embodied in its **element**,  
  **relationships**, and in the **principles** of its design and evolution.

- Goal of architecture design: To fulfill the **properties** of the target system.
- Constituents

  - Elements(components)
  - Relationships(Inter-component relationships)
  - Principles(Constraints on how the architecture consists of components and their relationships.)

- **Architecture reflects non-functional requirements** of the target system.

### Architectural Description(AD)

- A set of products that documents an architecture.

- AD must provide:
  - An **overal picture** that summarizes the whole system.
  - **Enough details** of the architecture so that it can be **validated** and the described system **can be built.**

### 4 Elements of Architecture Design

- Process: A systematic workflow of activities to design the software architecture.
- Styles: Defines an initial structure of the system.
- Viewpoints: Describes the architecture per view.
- NFR-driven Design: Applies architectural decisions and tactics to satisfy non-functional requirements.

## Architectural Style for Software

- Architectural style is a **named collection of architectural decisions** that are applicable in a given development context.

- Interpretation

  - Express fundamental structural **organization schema** for software systems.
  - Provide a set of **predefined element types** and specify their **responsibilities** by including rules and guidelines.

### Meta Elements of Architecture Styles

- Overview
- Situation
- Structure
- C&V(Commonality & Variability)
- Collaboration(runtime execution behavior)
- Consequence(pros & cons)
- Implementation(guidelines)

### Classification

- Architecture styles for **data flow systems**

  - **Batch Sequential** Architecture Style
  - **Pipe and Filter** Architecture Style

- Architecture styles for **data centered systems**

  - **Shared repository** Architecture Style
  - Active Repository Architecture Style
  - Blackboard Architecture Style

- Architecture styles for **layered systems**

  - **Layered Architecture** Style
  - **MVC(Model View Controller)** Architecture Style
  - PAC(Presentation Abstraction Control) Architecture Style

- Architecture styles for **tiered systems**

  - **N-Tier** Architecture Style
  - **Client-Server** Architecture Style
  - **Peer-to-Peer** Architecture Style

- And many more...

### Batch Sequential Architecture Style

- The functionality of the target system is decomposed into independent components for **manipulating datasets.**  
  A **series of data transformations** are made by the components **in sequential and batch** manner.

- A component **runs to completion, and transmits the whole output** before the **next component starts.**

### Pipe and Filter Architecture Style

- The **Filter** denotes a **component that manipulates a dataset,** and the **Pipe** denotes a **data bus which**  
  **transfers datasets a stream mode between filters**.

- There can be **parallelism** between the two filters.

### Shared repository Architecture Style

- Data Accessor Applications **share datasets through a central repository**.  
  Each **application accesses the shared repository directly without any intermediate layers or agents**.

- Key benefit is that this is an **efficient way of sharing datasets**.

### Layered Architecture Style

- The functionality of the system is **decomposed into a number of layers** and the layers are **vertically aligned**.

- **Each layer is given a unique role** in the system, and it **invokes the service provided by its immediate lower**  
  **layer**.

### Model View Controller Architecture Style

- MVC-based systems have only **three layers, Model, View, and Controller**.
- The 3 layers can be organized in two different ways:
  - Organized vertically
  - Fully connected for direct interaction between view layer and model layer.

### Client Server Architecture Style

- Consists of only two tiers; **client tier** and **server tier**.

---

## Architecture Viewpoints

### Architecture View

- **Architecture Description is organized into views,** which are analogous to the different types of blueprints.

### Architectural Views of Software

- Context View: Describes the relationships, dependencies, and interactions between the system and its environment.
- **Functional View**: Describes system's functional elements, their responsibilities, interfaces, and primary interactions.
- **Information View**: Describes the way that the architecture stores, manipulates, manages, and distributes information.
- **Behavior(Concurrency) View**: Describes the runtime structure, i.e. behavior of the system.
- Development View: Describes the architecture that supports the software development process.
- Deployment View: Describes the environment into which the system will be deployed.
- Operational View: Describes how the system will be operated, administered, and supported when it is running  
  its production environment.

## Architecture Design for NfR(Non-functional Requirements)

- **Architecture is for NFR**.
  - "The plan for implementing _non-functional requirements_ is detailed in the system architecture, because they are  
    usually architecturally significant requirements."
