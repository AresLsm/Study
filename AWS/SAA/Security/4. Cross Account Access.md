# Cross-Account Access

## Implementing Cross-Account Access using IAM

- Cross-account access allows IAM users from one AWS account to access services within a different AWS account  
  through the use of IAM roles.

- As this access is **not always required**, the IAM user must consciously switch to and assume the role to  
  access the other resources.

## Process

- (1) Create a new role from within the _trusting account_.
- (2) Specify the permissions attached to this newly created role which the users in the _trusted account_ would  
  assume to carry out their required actions and tasks.
- (3) Switch to the _trusted account_ to grant permissions, allowing them to assume the newly created role  
  in the _trusting account_.
- (4) Test the configuration by switching to the role.
