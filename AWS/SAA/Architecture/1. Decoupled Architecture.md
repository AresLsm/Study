# Decoupled Architecture

## What is Decoupled Architecture?

- Monolithic Architecture

  - Monolithic Applications are essentially tightly coupled together and had a lot of built in dependencies  
    against each other.

  - ex) Change of backend API can also change frontend.

- Decoupled Architecture

  - By using a decoupled architecture, you are building a solution put together using different components  
    and services that can operate and execute independently of one another.

  - Each component in a decoupled solution is effectively unaware of any other changes to other components  
    due to the segregation of boundaries applied.

  - Each service within a decoupled environment communicates with others using specific interfaces which  
    remain constant throughout its development.

## Event-Driven Architecture

- Services in an event-driven architecture are triggered by _events_ that occur within the infrastructure.

- Event-Driven architectures on AWS are typically composed of
  - Producer: The element within the infrastructure that will push an event to the event router.
  - Event Router: The element which process the event pushed by a producer, and takes the necessary action  
    in pushing the outcome to consumers.
  - Consumer: The element which executes the appropriate action as required.
